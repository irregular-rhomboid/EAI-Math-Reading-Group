# EAI-Math-Reading-Group

Machine Learning already relies on a lot of math, and with more and more researchers starting to bring mathematical tools from pure mathematics and physics into the field, many practitioners are starting to feel like they need to level up. Similarly, many people wanting to get started into alignment find themselves wishing they knew more advanced math.

If the previous paragraph sounds just like you, or you just like to learn math in general, consider joining this reading group. We usually meet on Sundays at 1PM Pacific on the EAI Discord server.

## Organisation
Since there are many different interesting topics, and sticking for months to a single one is difficult, our current plan is to have sessions on long running topics like Geometric Deep Learning interspersed with some shorter ones.

While we'll generally try to stay close to ML, some topics need a basic introduction, so we'll have some of those as well.

## Contributing
- If there are particular topics you'd like us to cover, feel free to let us know, and we'll add them to the list.
- If you are knowledgeable in some topic, and would like to present one or more sessions on it, we'd love to have you. Just open an issue on this repo with details on the topic, sources we can read and how many sessions you'd like to do.

## List of suggested topics
- Representation Theory
- Geometric Deep Learning
- Random Matrix Theory
- Partial Differential Equations
- Scientific Machine Learning
- Undergraduate Physics (Electromagnetism, Statistical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics)
- Dynamical Systems
- Topology
- Measure Theory
- Game Theory
